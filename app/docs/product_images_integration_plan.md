# PC Part Images Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating approximately 40 PC part images from `/home/rachid/imageget/pc_part_images/` into the Android shop application.

## Directory Structure
```
app/src/main/res/
└── drawable-nodpi/
    └── products/
        └── pc_parts/
            ├── processors/
            ├── motherboards/
            ├── graphics_cards/
            └── other_components/
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Directory Structure Setup
- Create new directory hierarchy in `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/products/pc_parts/`
- Use nodpi qualifier to prevent Android from creating multiple density versions
- Organize subdirectories by PC part categories for better management

### 2. Image Organization
- Copy images from source directory `/home/rachid/imageget/pc_part_images/`
- Implement naming convention: `pc_part_[category]_[id].jpg`
- Optimize images for mobile display:
  - Compress to reasonable file sizes
  - Maintain aspect ratios
  - Ensure consistent format (JPEG/PNG)

### 3. Database Integration
- Update product records with new image paths
- Use relative paths: `@drawable/products/pc_parts/[category]/[filename]`
- Create mapping between original filenames and new organized structure
- Verify all image references in database

### 4. Image Loading Implementation
- Consider implementing Glide or Picasso for efficient image loading
- Configure image caching for better performance
- Add placeholder images for loading states
- Implement error handling for missing images

## Benefits
- Organized and maintainable image structure
- Optimized for mobile display and performance
- Consistent naming convention
- Efficient loading and caching

## Next Steps
1. Create directory structure
2. Copy and optimize images
3. Update database records
4. Implement image loading enhancements
5. Test and verify implementation
